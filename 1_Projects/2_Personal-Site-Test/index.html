	I’m one of those people that is obsessed with making everything better. I see every failing as an opportunity and nothing is ever good enough. I see the world through a lens of critique, I actively look for problems; but I am not a pessimist, I’m a doer, a maker, a futurist and an idealist!
	<br>
	<br>My ability to write is something that I’ve never been completely satisfied with, and your class, like every English classes before, presents an opportunity for progression. I love opportunities, I take on as many as I can possibly handle!
	<br>
	<br>I was born in a small British Columbian town, Whiterock, on a cold March day (as my parents recall to me) almost 17 years ago. I spent my youth trolling boardwalks, beaches and ski hills. From a young age, I have engrossed myself in computers and their fantastical ability to enable and connect. Building programable LEGO, shooting and editing videos, designing graphics, doing type-setting, mocking up interfaces, writing computer programs, collaborating on projects for education, managing a website with a team of writers, editors, illustrators, photographers & videographers located in cities thousands of kilometres apart ARE ALL things I have done with computers, and things I was only capable of because of computers!

	Tons of technology websites exist, they all approach the space in their own way; but none of them are focused on explaining, expanding upon and predicting the answers of tomorrow. None of them are focused on providing Insight for the Future, Today — about a year ago, I got together with a team of brilliant people and we launched techtainian.com on January 8th, 2013.
	<br>
	<br>We've published content that has rocketed across social networks and engaged thousands of people in conversations about the future of technology. Techtainian has afforded me the opportunity to attend the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this past January and Press Events in New York City and Toronto.

	Last September, I heard about a group of teenagers in the United Kingdom who were working to improve how Computer Science is taught. They were building a space with the equipment, atmosphere and processes to educate the next wave of coders. They called their project Thinkspace and succeeded in creating the first location. Since, they have begun working with students and educators to build Thinkspaces in schools all around the world.
	<br>
	<br>I’m currently working with a group of students at Nelson to erect the first Thinkspace in Canada, we’re aiming to have it open for September 2014.

	The Internet has connected me to people who share my passions and understand my missions. It has given me the keys to the whole wide world and all I needed was the desire to discover. Last July, I was able to shadow The Verge video team in New York City, The Verge is a website covering Technology, Art, Science and Culture and one of the largest in its category!

	At the core of everything I’ve done, and continue to do, is communication: talking, presenting, explaining, listening, deriving, editing and writing. I hope I will improve my ability to communicate this semester and I am extremely excited to be pursuing this mission with you as my teacher.
