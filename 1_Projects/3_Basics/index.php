			Do not go gentle into that good night <br></br>

Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br></br>

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>Do not go gentle into that good night.<br></br>

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br></br>

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>Do not go gentle into that good night.<br></br>

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br></br>

And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br>Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
